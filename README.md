# The Standard

This repository contains the HTML player for the animations used in [The Standard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIB1V2i_qfRtDMcY6YZK1lkt).

It requires a browser that supports ES6 modules.
This includes Chrome 61+, Safari 10.1+ and othersâ€”it may be behind a flag in other browsers.
The player may have style/layout issues if not run on Chrome.

## Help

Type a question mark (?) to get help for keyboard shortcuts inside the player.
